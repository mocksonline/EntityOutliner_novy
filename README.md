## Features
**Entity Selector**

![GIF demonstrating use of the entity selector screen](https://i.imgur.com/XozyBa4.gif "It's a prefix search!")

This screen allows outlining of any entity in the game. There's a search bar for narrowing down entities and buttons to organize the results by entity category, deselect all entities, and toggle on/off the outlines. Entities added by other mods **do** appear in the results.

For the technically inclined, the search works using a precomputed hashtable that maps a string prefix to a corresponding list of results. The lists of results are computed for all prefixes that correspond at least one entity type.

**Controls for toggling the outlines and opening the selector**

Custom keybinds are provided to open the entity selector and toggle the outline. The outline can also be toggled via a button inside the entity selector.
